    <div class="container story">
      <p>Many schools in New York City have very high COVID incidence rates that far exceed local community rates. Because of differing student vaccination levels, these high rates pose greater risk for some school communities and the students within them.
        <p>

      <p>According to the Department of Education, P.S. 595 in the Bronx had a 23% vaccination rate as of November 2. While the High School for Math, Science, and Technology at City College had a 93% vaccination rate. They both also had a lot of COVID circulating relative to their population numbers the week ending November 5.
        <p>

      <p>High student incidence rates are difficult to see in the data provided on the Department of Education’s <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/health-and-wellness/covid-information/daily-covid-case-map">website </a>which offers only daily case rates or cumulative cases for the whole city.
        <p>

      <p>An analysis using official student register numbers and weekly cases to calculate incidence rates offers a more accurate picture. Five student cases in a week in a school with a population of 171 arrives at an incidence rate of 2,823 per 100,000. For comparison, most of New York City is currently hovering around an incidence of 200 cases per 100,000. Manhattan is the only borough that is not at a high community level according to the CDC’s measures.
        <p>

      <p>How can a school’s incidence rate be more than ten times higher than the community rate? One reason is rapid tests. The Department of Education counts them in the data, the city generally does not, and there is no system for reporting a positive at-home rapid test to the city.
      <p>

     <p>New Yorkers are not alone in having a hard time understanding how much COVID is circulating, says Dr. Bruce Lee, MD, professor of Health Policy and Management at the City University of New York, “Every place is sort of trying to underplay this because there's a lot of political push to make it seem like we're out of the pandemic.”
     </p>
     <p> In early March, New York City ended the mask mandate for public schools without creating any specific metrics for its reinstatement. In July, the city also removed an “alert level <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/covid/covid-19-alert-levels-definitions-actions.pdf">system”</a> that was designed to help New Yorkers “understand what precautions you need to take and how to best protect yourself and others.” For a while, the city’s COVID page said “We are re-evaluating the city’s COVID Alert system,” but no new alert system has been published.<p>

     <p>110 schools had incidence rates over 200 the week of ending November 5th — 59 of them had rates over 800.<p>

       </div>
     <p>41 of the 110 schools with incidence over 200 had vaccination rates lower than 60% — 24 of these schools had vaccination rates lower than 50%.<p>

    <p>The city’s <a href="https://twitter.com/NYCHealthCommr/status/1499141175181201409?s=20&t=EFfeq6zyes564VMZ4Wfx8w ">“vaccine equity strategy”</a> is difficult to detect when looking at the intersection of high student incidence and low student vaccination.</p>
    <p>"23% is just very low. That's way below where you want to be," said Dr. Lee. "You would probably want to be at least in the 80% range, when it comes to vaccination coverage."</p>
    <p>The week ending November 18, 45 children 0-17 were hospitalized with COVID. This number is more than double what it was <a href="https://pressnyc.github.io/"> at this time last year. </a>  </p>

    <p>“Public health recognizes the reality that our wellbeing often is interconnected,” said Stella Safo, MD, speaking in February on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=P2RvMVr4pTg"> panel </a> entitled “Pandemic while Black”. This interconnectedness was made clear by a study recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine, “Lifting Universal Masking in Schools – Covid-19 Incidence among Student and Staff,” by Dr. Tori Cowger and 7 other authors including New York State Health Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett. </p>

    <p>The researchers found that in schools that lifted mask mandates, “the additional cases translated to a minimum of approximately 17,500 missed school days for students and 6500 missed school days for staff during the 15-week period.” And they recommend districts, “use these findings to develop equitable mitigation plans in anticipation of a potential winter Covid-19 wave during the 2022–2023 school year, as well as clear decision thresholds for removing masks as the wave abates.”</p>
     <p>Dr. Lee says it's time to increase vaccinations and reinstate a mask mandate, "these are not going to work unless there's actually active campaigns to push these things."<p>
